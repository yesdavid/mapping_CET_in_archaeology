### Abstract:

Bibliometrics offers powerful means of visualising and understanding trends within research domains. We here present a first bibliometric analysis of cultural evolutionary theory as applied specifically within archaeology. Bibliographic coupling network analysis shows that there exists a broadly successive suite of author clusters making up the core of this research domain but also that a border vernacular version of cultural evolution is also commonly used in thematic or regional research traditions that fall outside of cultural evolutionary studies in the strict sense. Our bibliometric networks effectively trace the development of evolutionary archaeology over the last four decades and while they demonstrate the centrality of computational models, they also suggest a stagnation in the application of precisely that suite of methods - phylogenetics - that is central to evolutionary archaeologyâ€™s biological counterpart palaeontology. Recent methodological innovations in palaeobiology are, however, offering new ways of integrating artefact shape data directly with phylogenetic applications. This development may usher in a renaissance in artefact phylogenetics and appropriately marco-scale applications of cultural evolutionary theory in archaeology.
